# lightIDL

lightIDL is a fork of the original GNOME's project libIDL.

libIDL is a library for creating trees of CORBA Interface Definition Language
(IDL) files, which is a specification for defining portable interfaces. libIDL
was initially written for ORBit (the ORB from the GNOME project, and the
primary means of libIDL distribution). However, the functionality was designed
to be as reusable and portable as possible.

This derived work removed all dependencies from GLib, in order to make it more
embeddable.

The same license (GNU LGPL) had to be maintained.
